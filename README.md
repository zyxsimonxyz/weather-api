# Weather API

Swift playgrounds are provided for the [Weather API][] features listed below.
Each playground demonstrates parsing the JSON returned from the weather API for
a particular data feature. All weather data is provided by the [Weather
Underground][].

- alerts
- almanac
- astronomy
- autocomplete
- conditions
- currenthurricane
- forecast10day

An iOS application is available in the **AutoCompleteAPI** project to
demonstrate the autocomplete API. This app lists matching locations as the user
types the name or zip code of a location.
