Swift playgrounds for parsing JSON data returned from the [Weather Underground
API][]. Parsing examples of the following features of the API are listed below.

An iOS application is available in the **AutoCompleteAPI** project to
demonstrate the autocomplete API. This app lists matching locations as the user
